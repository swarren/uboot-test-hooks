# It requires:
# - standalone-hdctools to be installed at the same level as u-boot-test-hooks
#     (i.e. at /path/to/u-boot-test-hooks/../standalone-hdctools)
# - a servo board connected. Servo is used to control resetting the board and to
#     access the serial console
# - a servodrc also at the directory above u-boot-test-hooks (see sample below)
# - 'servo_name' variable set to the board name, before including this script

# Install hdctools here
